                founded in January
                2002 in
                partnership with the
                University of Westminster (UK, London) and the UMID Foundation of the first President of the Republic of
                Uzbekistan. The first study programmes, the Certificate of the International Foundation Studies and the
                Certificate of Higher Education in Business Administration, were validated by the University of
                Westminster in

                Our 100 year-old ancient building is beautifully located in the city center of Tashkent, the capital of
                Uzbekistan. The building construction resisted the largest earthquake in the history of Uzbekistan dated
                back to
                26th of April, 1966.

                The building was initially built in the period of Romanticism in Russian empire, between 1911-1912. It
                was the
                2nd Women's Gymnasium in Uzbekistan. Later, during the Soviet times, the building was donated to the
                Aviation
                College. The college was merged with the newly formed Tashkent Aviation Institute after half a century.
                In
                September 2002, after renovation and reconstruction works, Westminster University in Tashkent opened its
                doors
                to the first 120 students on the Level 3 Certificate of International Foundation Studies (CIFS) course,
                and the
                first year of the BA (Hons) Business Administration degree.
